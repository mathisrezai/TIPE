<h2>Experiment Report: Measured Amplitude Across the Primary Circuit Capacitor as a Function of Frequency</h2>

<p>
  The experiment involved plotting the measured amplitude across the reader capacitor as a function of frequency, both with and without resistance in the card circuit, as well as the difference between the two.
</p>

<p>We observed the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A maximum difference around 3540 Hz</li>
  <li>Two resonance peaks in the circuit with resistance</li>
  <li>One resonance peak in the circuit without the card</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chosen Characteristics:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>L1 = L2 = 9mH</li>
  <li>C1 = C2 = 0.22 µF</li>
  <li>Resistance: {0Ω, 1kΩ} (no significant influence when increasing resistance)</li>
  <li>Follower system (OpAmp)</li>
  <li>Function Generator (GBF): A = 1V peak-to-peak (approximately)</li>
  <li>Zero distance between the coils</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Large resistance = no card</li>
  <li>Low resistance = card present</li>
</ul>
