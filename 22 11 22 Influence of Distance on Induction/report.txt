<h2>Experiment Report: Voltage Across the Secondary Circuit Coil as a Function of Coil Distance</h2>

<p>
  This experiment involved plotting the voltage across the secondary circuit coil as a function of the distance between the coils.
</p>

<h3>Observations:</h3>
<p>
  The plot shows an exponential decay in voltage as the distance between the coils increases. At short distances (less than 20 mm), the voltage is high, peaking around 1.2 V. As the distance increases beyond 20 mm, the voltage gradually decreases, reaching nearly zero at around 100 mm. This confirms that distance has a significant impact on the voltage induced in the secondary coil.
