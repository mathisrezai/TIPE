<h2>Experiment Report: Voltage Across the Secondary Circuit Coil as a Function of Coil Distance</h2>

<p>
  This experiment involved plotting the voltage across the secondary circuit coil as a function of the distance between the coils.
</p>

<h3>Observations:</h3>
<p>
  The plot shows an exponential decay in voltage as the distance between the coils increases. At short distances (less than 20 mm), the voltage is high, peaking around 1.2 V. As the distance increases beyond 20 mm, the voltage gradually decreases, reaching nearly zero at around 100 mm. This confirms that distance has a significant impact on the voltage induced in the secondary coil.

<h3>Chosen Characteristics:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>L1 = L2 = 36mH</li>
  <li>Function Generator (GBF): A = 5V peak-to-peak, 1kHz</li>
</ul>





<p>
  I decided to investigate the influence of the distance between the two coils (one within the card and the other within the reader) on our card-reader modelisation.
</p>

<p>
  I plotted the amplitude of the received signal as a function of the distance between the coils.
</p>

<p>
  The results show a significant influence of distance on amplitude. At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient to transmit complex signals. However, this limitation is not problematic, as in our case, cards are generally positioned close to the reader.

<h1>Experiment Report: Influence of Distance on the induction effect</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this experiment was to investigate the influence of the distance between the two coils (one within the card and the other within the reader) on our card-reader modelisation. As long as when the card is not in front of the reader, no message is conveyed, the distance between those two must be an important actor in the induction phenomenon. 
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Building a circuit to study the phenomenon</h3>
<p>
    I decided to use two very simple circuits. The first circuit consists of a function generator (GBF) and a coil (I did not add an extra resistor due to the internal resistor of the GBF), which is connected to a simple coil where I measured the voltage.
</p>

<h3>2. Data Collecting</h3>
<p>
    To see to whats extent the impact of the distance between the coils is strong, I decided to investigate by plotting the amplitude of the voltage measured in the card as a function of the distance. I measured, for each value of distance between the two coils, the amplitude of the voltage around the isolated coil.
</p>

<h3>3. Observations</h3>
<p>
    By plotting all the values I gathered and analyzing the curves, I deduced the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distance has a significant influence on the amplitude of the voltage</li>
  <li>At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient to transmit complex signals.</li>
</ul>
