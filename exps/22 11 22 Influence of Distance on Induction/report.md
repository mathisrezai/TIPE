<h1>Experiment Report: Influence of Distance on the induction effect</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this experiment was to investigate the influence of the distance between the two coils (one within the card and the other within the reader) on the card-reader modelisation. In real life, as long as when a RFID card is not in front of the real reader, no message is conveyed, the distance between those two must be an important actor in the induction phenomenon. 
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Building a circuit to study the phenomenon</h3>
<p>
    I decided to use two very simple circuits. The first circuit consists of a function generator (GBF) and a coil (I did not add an extra resistor due to the internal resistor of the GBF), which is connected to a simple coil where I measured the voltage.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>L1 = L2 = 36mH</li>
  <li>Function Generator (GBF): A = 5V peak-to-peak, 1kHz</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Data Collecting</h3>
<p>
    To see to whats extent the impact of the distance between the coils is strong, I decided to investigate by plotting the amplitude of the voltage measured in the card as a function of the distance. I measured, for each value of distance between the two coils, the amplitude of the voltage around the isolated coil.
</p>

<h3>3. Observations</h3>
<p>
    By plotting all the values I gathered and analyzing the curves, I deduced the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distance has a significant influence on the amplitude of the voltage</li>
  <li>At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient to transmit complex signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  The results show a significant influence of distance on amplitude. At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient to transmit complex signals. However, this limitation is not problematic, as in our case, cards are generally positioned close to the reader.
