<h1>Experiment Report: Impact of Variable Resistance on Voltage Amplitude</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
    The goal of this experiment was to investigate how varying the resistance of a simulated RFID card affects the voltage amplitude measured across the capacitor in the primary circuit of the reader system. Specifically, we aimed to observe changes in amplitude as the card's resistance was adjusted.
</p>

<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p>
    In this setup, the reader circuit was connected to a low-frequency generator (LFG) that provided a constant voltage signal. A second circuit, representing an RFID card, was positioned at different distances from the reader. By varying the resistance of this secondary circuit, we analyzed its impact on the voltage measured in the reader's circuit.
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Measuring Voltage without the Card</h3>
<p>
    First, we measured the voltage amplitude across the capacitor of the reader's circuit without placing the simulated card in front of it. The measured amplitude was approximately 7.5 V.
</p>

<h3>2. Introducing the Simulated Card</h3>
<p>
    Next, we placed the circuit representing the RFID card in front of the reader and observed the effects of varying its resistance.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the card's resistance was set to a very low value (close to 0 Ω), the measured voltage in the reader's circuit dropped significantly from 7.5 V to 2.5 V.</li>
    <li>When the card's resistance was increased to a very high value (e.g., 1 kΩ), the amplitude returned to its initial value of 7.5 V, as if the card had no impact and no interaction was occurring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h3>
<p>
    The experiment demonstrated that the card's resistance has a significant impact on the voltage amplitude measured in the reader circuit. A low resistance caused a substantial reduction in amplitude, while a high resistance made the card’s influence negligible.
