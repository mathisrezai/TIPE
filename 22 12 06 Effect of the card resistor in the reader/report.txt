<h1>Experiment Report: Impact of Variable Resistance on Voltage Amplitude</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
    The goal of this experiment was to investigate how varying the resistance of a simulated RFID card affects the voltage amplitude measured across the capacitor in the primary circuit of the reader system. Specifically, we sought to observe the changes in amplitude when the card's resistance was altered.
</p>

<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p>
    In this setup, the reader circuit was connected to a low-frequency generator (LFG) that provided a constant voltage signal. 
    A second circuit representing an RFID card was placed at different distances from the reader. By varying the resistance of this secondary circuit, we aimed to analyze how it impacted the voltage measured in the reader's circuit.
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Measuring Voltage without the Card</h3>
<p>
    First, we measured the voltage amplitude across the capacitor of the reader's circuit without placing the simulated card in front of it. 
    The measured amplitude was approximately 7.5V.
</p>

<h3>2. Introducing the Simulated Card</h3>
<p>
    Next, we placed the circuit representing the RFID card in front of the reader and began observing the effects of changing its resistance.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the card's resistance was set to a very small value (close to 0 Ohms), the measured voltage in the reader's circuit dropped significantly from 7.5V to 2.5V.</li>
    <li>However, when the card's resistance was increased to a very high value (such as 1kOhm), the amplitude returned to its initial value of 7.5V, as if the card had disappeared and no interaction was taking place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
    The experiment demonstrated that the resistance of the card has a significant impact on the voltage amplitude measured in the reader circuit. A low resistance causes a major reduction in amplitude, while a high resistance makes the card's influence negligible.
