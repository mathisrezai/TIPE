<h2>Experiment Report: Influence of Distance on the induction effect</h2>

<p>
  I decided to investigate the influence of the distance between the two coils (one within the card and the other within the reader) on our card-reader modelisation.
</p>

<p>
  I plotted the amplitude of the received signal as a function of the distance between the coils.
</p>

<p>
  The results show a significant influence of distance on amplitude. At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient to transmit complex signals. However, this limitation is not problematic, as in our case, cards are generally positioned close to the reader.
